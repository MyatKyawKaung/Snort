<h2 align="center"> Snort Intrusion Detection Lab </h2>
SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS).
In this demo, I will be using Snort3 as an IDS which logs the malicious traffics that are generated from my Kali attack machine, according to the predefined snort's rule.

This step-by-step guide will help you set up Snort3 using Ubuntu 22.04 server and Kali Linux for traffic generation and testing.
### Prerequisites
* **Ubuntu server**: This will host the Snort IDS. </br>
* **Kali Linux** : This will use to generate network traffic to test Snort.
* Ensure your Ubuntu server and Kali Linux are updated.
* Make sure you have administrative access to both systems.
